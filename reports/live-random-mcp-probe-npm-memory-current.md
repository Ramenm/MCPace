This report covers real package-manager downloads only when run with `--download`. It sends only `initialize`, `notifications/initialized`, and `tools/list`. It does not call tools.

## Summary

- Servers: 1
- OK: 1
- Failed/startup-blocked: 0
- Tools discovered: 9
- Policy mismatches: none
- Unexpected failures: none
- Server-side requests handled: none

## Results

| Server | Kind | Package | Status | Tools | Risk signals | Suggested policy |
|---|---|---|---:|---:|---|---|
| official-memory | npm | @modelcontextprotocol/server-memory@2026.1.26 | ok | 9 | memory-or-context, mutable-or-destructive-tools | state-profile-single-session |

## Safety

- Package install scripts allowed: false
- User secrets passed to runtime: false
- Destructive tool calls allowed: false

## Notes

- Only initialize, notifications/initialized, and tools/list were sent.
- No user API keys or user home directory were passed to runtime processes.
- npm install uses --ignore-scripts, --no-audit, --no-fund, --omit=dev, isolated HOME/cache, and a whitelisted package-manager environment.
- PyPI installs happen in a disposable venv with isolated cache/HOME and a whitelisted package-manager environment; runtime processes receive a stripped environment.
- Runtime network namespace isolation uses unshare -Urn when this host allows it; otherwise the probe falls back to stripped env + timeout only.
- This is a smoke probe. It is not a source security audit and it does not prove destructive tool behavior is safe.
- Some canaries are hard-skipped unless --allow-heavy-installs is passed because package-manager installs can hang in restricted mirrors.
